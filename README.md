# Key Questions

1. A global alert system with coordinated responses can help to reduce the impact of disasters and
disease outbreaks. What components should such a global alert system to combat health risks
consist of?
2. How can the “last mile problem” be overcome to create sustainable risk awareness? (The “last mile
problem” in the health-context denotes the problem to establish the challenging link between per-
sons in risk situations and relevant information, which can help to combat the risk).
3. How can medical research implemented in space or in analogues be more efficiently used for
healthcare on the planet? How can related technology be better utilised (spin-offs)?
4. How can SGAC/students and young professionals contribute to this topic?
5. How could UNISPACE+50 or SGAC/students and young professionals contribute to this topic?
